"Globally, about 8.9% of the world’s population — 690 million people — go to bed on an empty stomach each night. Since 2014, the number of people affected by hunger has been slowly on the rise. If it continues at this rate, it’ll exceed 840 million by 2030.",
"The hunger Sustainable Development Goal calls for ending hunger in the world by 2030. Unfortunately — with world hunger on the rise — this goal will likely not be met, even without considering the effects of COVID-19. Estimates suggest that an additional 83 million to 132 million more people will be chronically hungry due to the pandemic.",
"Extreme poverty rates fell from nearly 36% in 1990 to 9.2% in 2017. However, having the economic means to access nutritious food is also affected by food prices and people’s purchasing power, which have both varied widely in recent years. With a healthy diet costing more than the international poverty line of $1.90 a day, it remains unaffordable for people living in extreme poverty.",

//usda gov
"The USDA estimated that 11.1% of US households were food insecure in 2018.  This means that approximately 14.3 million households had difficulty providing enough food for all their members due to a lack of resources. Rates of food insecurity were substantially higher than the national average for households with incomes near or below the Federal poverty line.",
"2019’s report, using data from December 2018, shows that 88.9 percent of American households were food secure throughout the entire year, meaning that all household members had access at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life.",

//actionagainsthunger
"There is more than enough food produced in the world to feed everyone on the planet.",
"Small farmers, herders, and fishermen produce about 70 percent of the global food supply, yet they are especially vulnerable to food insecurity – poverty and hunger are most acute among rural populations.",
"An estimated 14 million children under the age of five worldwide suffer from severe acute malnutrition, also known as severe wasting, yet only 25 percent of acutely malnourished children have access to lifesaving treatment.",

//opportunity.org
"Hunger is the cause of 45% of all children's deaths",
"As the largest and most populated continent, Asia is home to approximately 4.427 billion people. Unfortunately, more than 550 million people part of that population suffers from hunger."
